          <SectionText >
            As the User Interface Designer intern, I was involved in redesigning phases only from the Transjakarta and Android app old menu and old feature 
            into high fidelity design. I worked with a Product Manager. There was no research for this project because weâ€™re on short time, so I redesign it based on the app which has existed before.
